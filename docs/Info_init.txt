## Highlights of this 10/10 Structure

1. **Adaptive Multi-Layer (AML) Approach**  
   - **Sharding** (`blockchain/sharding/`) to split the network into smaller, more manageable parts for parallel processing.  
   - **Layer-2 Solutions** (`layer2_solutions/`) that incorporate **ZK rollups**, **sidechains**, and **state channels** to handle large transaction volumes off-chain and settle on-chain.  
   - An **Aggregator** module manages cross-layer coordination, ensuring a seamless experience for users switching between L1 and L2.

2. **Clearly Defined Modules**  
   - **`blockchain`** folder encapsulates all core blockchain operations (consensus, networking, data structures).  
   - **`cryptocurrency`** folder focuses on coin logic, wallet functionality, mining/staking, transaction fees, and supply rules.  
   - **`api`** provides a clean gateway for external clients (wallet apps, block explorers, third-party integrations).  
   - **`ui`** is separated into subfolders (`wallet`, `block_explorer`, `admin_dashboard`) with well-defined components/services/assets.

3. **Robust Testing and Monitoring**  
   - **`test`** contains **unit_tests**, **integration_tests**, and **performance_tests**, ensuring each part of the system is reliable and efficient.  
   - **`monitoring`** helps you set up dashboards and alert systems to keep track of the health and performance of the network.

4. **Documentation for All Audiences**  
   - **`docs`** directory includes comprehensive documentation for developers, operators, and end-users. An **architecture_overview.md** explains how the AML approach works and the role of each layer.

5. **Scalability and Innovation**  
   - By combining **sharding** and **Layer-2** rollups with **ZKP** technology, your project can grow without compromising on security or decentralization.  
   - The design is modular, making it easy to swap out or upgrade components (e.g., changing the consensus mechanism).
